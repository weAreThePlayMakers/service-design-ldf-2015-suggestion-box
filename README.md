[service-design-ldf-2015-suggestion-box](https://suggestionboxsdldf2015.stamplayapp.com/) with authentication and some gamification added with main features being:

- Allow users to login with Google
- When they login, send them a welcome email
- Let users add suggestions
- When their suggestion gets 5 up-votes, email them congratulations


the whole app is a [clone of an app](https://github.com/scotch-io/angular-stamplay) created by guys at scotch.io and was created by me following simple step by step tutorial on [their site](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-angularjs-app-with-stamplay-the-ifttt-for-developers).

you will find there info about the platform as well as instructions.

you can access the app by going to `https://suggestionboxsdldf2015.stamplayapp.com/` or clicking on the graphic below

as you can see the app has very basic styling and this is something I would like to change as a first step in customising it for our purposes.

I'll be updating on significant changes in respect of the app but by all means I implore you to try and use it. I've been working with stamplay for quite few months now and I am rather impressed on how powerful it is and what awesome stuff can be easily built with it. I need your input though if I am to create quickly something awesome for your users. you know the drill :-)

if you have questions
